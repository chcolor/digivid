<h2>Reading 2: Foucault and The Panopticon</h2>

<img class="self" src="pictures/panopticon.jpg" height="250" alt="foucault's panopticon"/> 


<h3>Q1. What is the idea behind the Panopticon and what is its distinctive feature that is more than just the act of direct surveillance?</h3>

<p>The Panopticon was a conceptualized prison that was created in order to deal with the growing population of incarcerated individuals. 
In this system, there would be a large, round, tower-like structure with cells around the outside. 
All of these cells would be completely visible from the center of the structure where a guard tower would be placed.
</p>
<p>The feature that sets the Panopticon apart from previous concepts is the idea that the prisoners are never sure whether they are actually being watched at any given moment. 
This creates an atmosphere of paranoia in which the prisoner regulates his own actions out of fear for impending punishment. 
This self-regulation becomes an ingrained reaction and, in theory, rehabilitates the prisoner with little or no intervention from the penal institution.</p>

<h3>Q2.  What is your privacy definition these days. what information about you is fair for the public to know about, what do you want to keep private. Do you care?</h3>

<p>I believe there are levels of perceived privacy. The first level would be the idea of privacy in a public place. 
At this level, anything you do or say is public knowledge so act accordingly. The second level would be in your own home. 
Here you control what enters and leaves and should have the ability to control this transfer of information. The third level is on the internet. 
While most people feel that this should be a place that respects their privacy, the truth is much different. 
When in an electronic space information is being transferred from your own controlled environment, through an infrastructure that you have no control over and no way of tracking, 
to an endpoint that may or may not respect your wish for privacy. So, on this level, it is safe to assume that nothing "published" electronically is private. 
This includes email, credit card information, personal vital statistics, photos, videos, chat logs... the list goes on. </p>
<p> As a person that values my privacy, the thought that many different companies or entities could be tracking my activities troubles me deeply.
Many people feel that if someone has nothing to hide then there is no reason to object to surveillance. 
I, however, come from the point of view that our justice system is too flawed and, when viewed through the right lens, even the most benign of activities could seem to point to some kind of wrong-doing. 
As far as companies tracking my comings and goings in an electronic arena, I get incredibly angry at the thought that a company is earning money off of me and my meticulously curated personality. 
It has taken me years to develop such refined tastes and preferences and I feel as though I should be payed for my work. Then again, I am something of a narcissist.</p>
 
<h3>Q3.  What is the difference between the act of voyeurism as it relates to things like Reality TV and the act of Surveillance?</h3>

<p> Voyeurism in relation to reality tv seems to be defined by a sense of consent. The actors and the viewers both know that an exchange is taking place. 
The actors can choose to curtail their activities to suit whatever interests they might have. The viewers can choose whether they will watch or not. </p>
<p> Surveillance on the other hand, typically is done covertly, for a specific purpose or intent. The nature of covert surveillance means that you typically 
encounter people doing things they might not do if they knew they were being watched. This means that the surveiller gets a much more intimate look at the subject. 
This also means, however, that if the person being surveilled finds out they have been recorded, they might become angry or embarrassed. </p> 


<h3>Q4. For all of the artist examples above, please try and categorize  their approuch into 1 of the 3 defined below?</h3>
<p>
These are:
</p>
<ul><li>A. Uses an existing surveillance system and performs in it.</li>

<li>B. Design and uses their own surveillance system or uses common surveillance technology.</li>

<li>C. Conduct an inverse surveillance or sousveillance project.</li></ul>
