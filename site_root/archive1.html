<h2>Video 1</h2>
<video width="490" controls >
  <source src="video/intro.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

 <p> This is my Introduction video. I shot it on a sunny afternoon in my apartment complex. I think if I were to do it again I would pick a quieter place.</p>
 

<h2>Video 2</h2>
<video width="490" controls>
  <source src="video/framestoweb.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>
<p> This video was a framing exercise. The point of the project was to cut video so that there were interesting transitions that occurred "naturally" in the footage. Mine ended up being about planes.</p>

  
  
<h2>Video 3</h2>
<video width="490" controls>
  <source src="video/interviewtoweb.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>

<p> This video is a "concealed interview." In it I recommend a great canoeing destination, Everglades National Park in Florida.</p>


  <h2>Video 4</h2>
<video width="490" controls>
  <source src="video/narrativetoweb.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<p> This is a narrative video. The story is timeless, cats are lazy creatures that have somehow convinced us humans to do their bidding.</p>

  <h2>Video 5</h2>
<video width="490" controls>
  <source src="video/nonnarrativetoweb.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<p>This is my non-narrative video. You really have to just watch it and see. There aren't words. It's Weird.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Video 6</h2>

</video>
  <p> 
    This is my remix video. I started mixing it by playing around with the beat but then, when I added a video about self image shot in the 70's it took on a whole new meaning. I hope you like it.
